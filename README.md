You can find the images using the following link [Rice Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/rice-image-dataset).

The original data contains images of 5 Different Types of Rice and each type contains 15000 images bringing the total to 75000. 

## About the Annotated Data
For Preparing the Images for Object Detection and Object Segmentation, An Automatic Annotator Script was developed in Python. Because the annotations were created Automatically, they have a High Degree of Accuracy.

The Annotations are in [LabelMe](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme) [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) format. Annotation JSONs also contain the encoded version of the images that can be used to recreate the images if the need arise.
